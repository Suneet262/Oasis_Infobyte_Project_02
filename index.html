                <h3>About Steve Jobs</h3>
                <p>Steve Jobs (1955-2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, and inventor. He was
                    the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc., a company renowned for its innovative products and
                    revolutionary approach to technology.</p>
                <p>Jobs played a pivotal role in shaping the personal computer industry with the introduction of the
                    Macintosh in 1984. His visionary leadership and relentless pursuit of excellence led to the creation
                    of iconic products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming multiple industries along the
                    way.</p>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He showed an early interest in
                electronics and technology, often tinkering with electronic components in his garage.</p>
            <p>In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) along with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.
                Their mission was to develop and sell personal computers that were user-friendly and accessible to
                everyone.</p>

            <h3>Insanely Great</h3>
            <p>During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. 
               In 1979 he led a small group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient.
               Soon afterward, Jobs left the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. 
            </p>
            <p>Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists, but his style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great but “insanely great.”
               In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. 
               It would later be pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.”

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs left an indelible mark on the world of technology and design. His emphasis on simplicity,
                elegance, and user experience revolutionized the way we interact with technology.</p>
            <p>His relentless pursuit of perfection and his ability to anticipate consumer needs set Apple apart from
                its competitors, making it one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.</p>
